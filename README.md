# PROJECT 2 - MOTOR MATCHER 

As a group we created "Motor Matcher", an app that allows you to buy and sell vehicles. The arrives at our homepage with the option to login to view the listings or creating one of their own. Once logged in, they can search the website via filters on the buy page or generically on the homepage. If they are looking to sell a vehicle, they can select "create a listing" from the homepage or navigate to the "sell" page in the header and complete the form for the posting.

This app allows users to avoid the chaos of other options (like Kijiji) and focus on vehicles they would like to buy or sell. 

# Technologies used:
- Node
- Express

# Future Developments:
- Homepage intial landing will show a preview of the current ads but you will have to create an account or login to view them fully
- Once logged in, button will change to "logout"
- Photo upload button for your listing would be completed using npm package multer
- Once listing is "posted" it routes to the "your listings page" 
- Listings form updated so that the year of vehicle would be a drop down and give a specific # of years (ie. 2005-2025)
- "Your listings" page shows the full details of the listing
- Listings will have a form where you can send an inquiry email to the seller (npm package nodemailer to be used)
- Review system giving feedback on their interactions
- Showcase popular car or sponsored ads on the homepage and search results so they are easy to see/select for users
- Users would get up to a certain ad sum (ie. 5 ads) for free and then more ads would be a fee
- Option to "sponsor" ads so that they show up in the showcase or top of the search results for a fee
- Optional page - "trade" where you can list a vehicle you would like to swap with someone else
